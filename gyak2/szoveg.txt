Le Mans has seen photo-finishes, terrible crashes, speed records broken
again and again, and plenty of unbelievable vehicles. It has long been
at the forefront of automotive pioneering and innovation issuing from
major car companies, spurred on by a desire to beat their rivals out
for the claim to the illustrious championship, and status as the most
rugged, durable super car maker in the continent – if not the world.
It is a deep, and rich history, full of innovation and brilliance,
wild stories, sometimes catastrophic mishaps. To understand Le Mans
is to understand the history of European – and eventually American –
auto racing at large; to see how the tides shifted, trends started,
and how companies rose and fell from prominence like spokes on a wheel.
The History of Le Mans is fascinating, and too expansive to summarize
simply – still we’ve taken the liberty of condensing it into a slightly
quicker rundown, so that you can get the distillation of Europe’s
greatest Endurance race. Warning: don’t blink. It goes fast.
